# Telegram clone with React.js and Google Firebase

## Project's Scope
The idea with this project was to create something outside the norm when we talk about junior projects for a portfolio. For example, the classics like Pokedexes ([I have made one, and you can check it out here](https://github.com/JFilgueira/pokedex-react)). I hope that I accomplished something unique with this real-time chat application and the technologies used to build it.

* Authenticate login with Google
* Send real-time messages in the chat
* Access main information through a profile menu
* Dark mode
* Responsive yet to be done
* Most of what you see is for design purposes; the functionality relies on the chat and the menu icon
* [Live preview on Vercel](https://pokedex-react-flax.vercel.app/)
