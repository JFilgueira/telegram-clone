# Telegram clone with React.js and Google Firebase

## Project's Scope
The ideia with this project was to create something out of the curve when we talk about juniors projects for portfolio, for exemple the classics Pokedéx's([which I have made one and you can check here](https://github.com/JFilgueira/pokedex-react)). And I hope that I accomplished something like that with this real time chat application and the technologies used to do it.

* Login authenticated with Google
* Send message in a real time chat
* View your main info in a profile menu
* Dark mode
* Responsive yet to be made!
* Most what you see is for design purpose, the functionality relies in the chat and the menu icon
* [Live preview on Vercel](https://pokedex-react-flax.vercel.app/)
